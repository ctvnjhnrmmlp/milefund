# Milefund: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding System for NGOs in Cabuyao, Philippines

## Overview

This project explores the use of blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency in crowdfunding platforms, specifically for NGOs in Cabuyao, Philippines. The system leverages blockchain's decentralized and secure nature to address common issues such as fund mismanagement, donor trust, and high transaction costs seen in traditional crowdfunding platforms. By integrating smart contracts and decentralized identity verification, the proposed system ensures milestone-based fund disbursement, which reduces operational inefficiencies and promotes accountability.

## Problem Statement

- **Lack of Transparency**: Donors have limited visibility on how their funds are being utilized.
- **Poor Security & Accountability**: Mismanagement and misuse of funds undermine donor trust.
- **Low User Engagement**: Current platforms fail to provide a reliable, engaging user experience.

This project aims to create and evaluate a blockchain-based crowdfunding system that:

- Improves donation tracking and fund security.
- Increases donor trust and engagement.
